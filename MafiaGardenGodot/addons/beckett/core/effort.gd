## AI effort tiers (1..6) — the dial behind the dock's effort slider.
##
## Every tool we advertise costs the model prompt tokens (its description + JSON
## schema ships on every tools/list). Most sessions only need a slice of the
## tools, so we let the user cap the surface: a lower tier exposes fewer tools =
## cheaper context = a sharper, faster model, at the cost of capability.
##
## Tiers are CUMULATIVE and follow the real workflow: inspect -> author -> run
## -> see -> drive -> ship. Level N exposes its own tools plus every lower level's.
##
## L4 is also the EDITION line: the free Lite build ships L1..L4 (inspect, author,
## the run loop, and SEEING the running game — screenshot, live tree, runtime
## reads), so it can watch and diagnose the game. L5..L6 (the agent DRIVES and
## verifies the game — input, clicks, asserts; shipping tools) are Full-edition
## modules.

# Tools UNLOCKED AT each level (the delta over the level below). Grouped by the
